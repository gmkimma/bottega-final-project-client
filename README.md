# Capstone Project for Bottega - BEAT BLACKJACK

This project is live at [Here](https://bottega-project-kimma-frontend-08a97854118f.herokuapp.com/)

You can create your own login.

It is far from being a completed card counting app.

However, you can choose 2 cards for the player and a face up card for the dealer, and the app will tell you basic strategy.

I hope you like what I have so far, and I will continue to make it better!

## The surrender, split, double, stand, and hit buttons do not work

## I had a lot of trouble with the backend and deloying this app to Heroku, but I learned a lot in the process

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
